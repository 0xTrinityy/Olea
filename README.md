## Introduction

ðŸŒ± Olea is a revolutionary Comprehensive Green Bonds Ecosystem that leverages the power of blockchain technology, specifically Ethereum and Starknet, to promote and facilitate investments in environmentally friendly projects. This ecosystem is designed to bring full transparency and accessibility to the world of green bonds, enabling everyone to participate in and support groundbreaking environmental initiatives.

The project is based on Ethereum network but it will be also deployed on Starknet, using Cairo, in order to maximize the investors, seeds and users experience by decreasing fees thanks to 
Layer 2 (more is comming when the contract will be uploaded directly on Madara, an App-chain System based on starknet).

Olea not only facilitates investments but also empowers project owners to promote their initiatives to a global audience. This platform serves as a hub for project creators to share their visions and progress, attracting potential investors and supporters.

## Getting Started

To start using Olea, follow these steps:

2. **Deploy and run the smart contract** : Implement the contract and dependencies directly in an ethereum based IDE like remix or truffle, ```compile```
the contract, then ```deploy``` it and add the parameters that you want for the contract value (Keep in mind that you have to use a wallet like metamask, smartWallet..etc).
